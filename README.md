This code is used for detecting lanes, traffic lights and other objects during day and night. It uses the Mask R-CNN inception v2 Coco model for object detection in the input video. The code also performs tracking and warning of vehicle collisions with the help of tracking objects and estimation functions. In the beginning, user will select a region of interest (ROI) to determine the position of the dashcam in the vehicle. It then detects if it is a day or night scene. If the scene is during day time, the lane detection algorithm is initiated and the ROI for the bird' eye view is taken for further processing. The traffic signals are also detected and tracked in the frame. If the scene is during night time, the objects inside the frame are detected and tracked. The code can be used to detect objects and take a warning to the driver.
